            <time> july 26, 2022</time>
            <p>The article here show that Saharan dust carried over the Atlantic Ocean provides important nutrients, 
                like phosphorus and iron, to the ocean. These nutrients help phytoplankton grow,
                which supports marine life and can capture carbon, helping fight climate change.
                This research highlights how land and ocean ecosystems are connected and suggests 
                that knowing how dust moves is important for understanding ocean health.</p>
